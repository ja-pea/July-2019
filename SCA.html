                <p class="width">This term refers to European legislation that will be implemented on Setpember 14th 2019. This will effect all online transactions. Our task was to add an extra layer of security for the user to log into their online bank account. We have
                    three methods to do this but I will be focusing on one. Mobile push notification for log in. For many this will be a forced change and would have to download our app for the first time. <br>

                <p class="width">From previous testing we knew our desktop/tablet users tended to bank in a certain way and for some made a made concious choice not use the AIB mobile app for banking. This gave a clear direction for our content and flow. Early testing
                    told us users wanted direct language, clear imagry and actions for what they had to do. We used testing sessions to test our flow and mark pain points in the jounrey. We used numerous rounds of testing to fix identified areas in the
                    journey.

                    At some stage all customers will be forced to set up a new log in method. We needed to highlight it is a quick and easy one time set up. But also that they would need to do this new process every time they logged onto their account from now on.

                <h2 class="width">Downloading the app</h2>

                <p class="width">This was one of our toughest parts of the design. The push to get users from their web browser onto their phone was the most challenging part of this flow.<br> The Next button was disabled to ensure people downloaded the app before continueing.
                    When they completed the steps on the page the button would be active and they would be able to continue. This got push back on a number of occasions from our development team but we were able to show from our usability testing it was
                    extremely important.
