                        <p>This term refers to European legislation that will be implemented on Setpember 14th 2019. This will effect all online transactions. Our task was to add an extra layer of security for the user to log into their online bank account.
                            We have three methods to do this but I will be focusing on one. Mobile push notification for log in. For many this will be a forced change and would have to download our app for the first time This required numerous rounds
                            of testing for content feedback.</p>

                        <p>Internet banking persona</p>

                        <p>Early in the design process I broke our users into two groups 1)customers who use both mobile and internet banking 2)internet banking only users. The mobile journey on the app was quick and easy so anyone who was AIB Mobile app
                            user would only sign up on their phone. For our other user the internet banking only user, they would need to download the AIB mobile app.</p>

                        <p>From previous testing/interviews we know internet banking only users tended to bank in a certain way. These user tend to be particularly in the way that they bank and made a concious choice not use mobile phone for banking. This
                            helped create our content.Early testing told us users wanted direct language, clear imagry and actions for what they had to do. We used real images as opposed to illustrations which did not test well and numerous rounds of
                            word adjustments.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        Selection At some stage all customers will be forced to set up a new log in method. We needed to highlight it is a quick and easy one time set up. But also that they would need to do this new process every time they logged onto their account from now
                        on.

                        <p>Downloading the app</p>

                        <p>This was one of our toughest parts of the design. The push to get users from their web browser onto their phone was the most challenging part of this flow.<br> The Next button was disabled to ensure people downloaded the app before
                            continueing. When they completed the steps on the page the button would be active and they would be able to continue. This got push back on a number of occasions from our development team but we were able to show from our usability
                            testing it was extremely important.
