                <p class="width">The project came from the rise in customers using Revolut. There were theories and assumptions being made within AIB as to why this was without any research. As a side project myself and a team member carried out interviews to gather data.
                    We used techniques from a ‘Jobs to be done’ format. We were investigating what was pushing customers to use Revolut but also using AIB as their main bank account.</p>

                    We gatherd data from analyticss and could see Revolut was most popular with the age group 26 to 35. We used this as our target group to interview.<br> We interviewed nine people to find out what pushed them to download the app and
                    how were they were using their Revolut account. The real emphasis of what we were investigating was what was the push factor, what was the trigger for them to download the app? It was also important to figure out why were they still
                    using their AIB account.

                    At some stage all customers will be forced to set up a new log in method. We needed to highlight it is a quick and easy one time set up. But also that they would need to do this new process every time they logged onto their account from now on.

                <p class="width">This was one of our toughest parts of the design. The push to get users from their web browser onto their phone was the most challenging part of this flow.<br> The Next button was disabled to ensure people downloaded the app before continueing.
                    When they completed the steps on the page the button would be active and they would be able to continue. This got push back on a number of occasions from our development team but we were able to show from our usability testing it was
                    extremely important.
