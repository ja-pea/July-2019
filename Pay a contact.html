                <p class="width">The project came from the rise in customers using Revolut. There were theories and assumptions being made within AIB as to why this was without any research. As a side project myself and a team member carried out interviews to gather data.
                    We used techniques from a ‘Jobs to be done’ format. We were investigating what was pushing customers to use Revolut but also using AIB as their main bank account.</p>

                    We gatherd data from analyticss and could see Revolut was most popular with the age group 26 to 35. We used this as our target group to interview.<br>
                    <br>We interviewed nine people to find out what pushed them to download the app and how were they were using their Revolut account. The real emphasis of what we were investigating was what was the push factor, what was the trigger
                    for them to download the app? It was also important to figure out why were they still using their AIB account.

                <p class="width"> Our strongest insight from our research showed that people viewed Revolut as a quick way to transfer money. For most people they ended up downloading Revolut because of a friend or a group payment.<br>
                    <br>We wanted people to send money to other AIB customers quickly and easily. We investigated the capablitlty of linking our users profile with their numbers on file so we they could send money to a number/person they know as opposed
                    to to bank details that are awkward.
