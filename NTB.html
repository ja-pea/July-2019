                    <p class="width">Opening a bank account remotely on your mobile phone was launched July 2018 from a seperate team to mine. At a later stage our team was asked to create a similar journey to open a bank remotely on your mobile phone for students. <br>                        While reviewing the 35 page flow we saw there was huge drop off rates that needed to be addressed. Before developing the new journey we needed to improve aspects of the orginal flow. Due to limited time we had to scale back our
                        design improvments to the essentials.</p>

                    <p class="width">We had a short timeline to implment these improvments before starting the new project. We had to gather analytics and test improvments in a short time frame before development.<br> The image on the right highlights the large drop offs
                        at various points and the over all completion rate of 5%.<br> The areas of focus:<br>
                        <br> - Keep the user informed about the process and were they are<br>
                        <br> - Illustrate the difference in all the numbers they need to know<br>
                        <br> - Help them complete the process and not block them at any stage<br>
                        <br> - Clean up UI inconsistencies with app.<br>

                    Once the user finished the flow and logged in there is one more step. To verify the persons address and identity a code is sent in the post. Intially people did not know what this code was and entered different numbers into this area. If they entered
                    the code wrong five times they would block their account before it was even active. To prevent this from happening we added an illustration to highlight the letter in the post and let the user enter the code wrong as many times as
                    they wanted for the first three days while the it was in the post. <br>

                    <br>The key thing we implmemented was progress screens to inform the user as to what to expect and what stage of the journey they were at. These tested well and also informed the user what documents they may need.
